# ResQAI üö®ü§ñ

**ResQAI** is an advanced disaster response and management system designed to enhance coordination among government agencies, citizens, volunteers, and NGOs during natural calamities like earthquakes, floods, and cyclones. By leveraging AI and real-time data, ResQAI aims to improve response times, predict resource needs, and streamline communication among all stakeholders.

## üöÄ Setup Procedure

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- Python (v3.8 or higher)
- Google Cloud SDK

### Steps to Run Locally

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ResQAI/ResQAI.git
   cd ResQAI
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set Up Environment Variables**:

   Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following:

   ```env
   # Environment Variables
   NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=
   NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=
   NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=
   NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=
   NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=
   NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=
   NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=
   NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID=
   NEXT_PUBLIC_JWT_SECRET=
   ```

4. **Start the Development Server**:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. **Access the Application**:

   Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.

<br/>

## üìö How It Works

1. **Disaster Alert**:

   - Government agencies issue disaster alerts via a centralized interface.
   - Alerts are stored in Google Cloud Firestore and displayed on the home page for users.

2. **Resource Management**:

   - Users can view, accept, or reject resource requests based on real-time needs.
   - AI suggests optimized allocation of resources and manpower.

3. **Situational Reports**:

   - Generate detailed reports with AI assistance.
   - Use Gemini-1.5 Flash 001 and Vertex AI for autofill functionality based on historical data and real-time inputs.
   - Generate detailed analysis on stored reports on disaster using Gemini-1.5 Pro-002.

4. **Collaborative Communication**:

   - Departments can chat in disaster-specific groups to coordinate tasks efficiently.
   - Built using Socket.IO for real-time communication.

5. **Geospatial Insights**:

   - Visualize affected areas and evacuation routes using Google Maps API.
   - Analyze satellite data with Google Earth Engine.

## üåê Deployment

ResQAI is deployed on **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)** to ensure scalability and reliability. The infrastructure includes:

- **Google Cloud Run**: Hosting the backend and AI services.
- **Google Cloud Storage**: Storing disaster-related data, reports, and logs.
- **Google Cloud Firestore**: Real-time database for disaster alerts and user data.

<br/>

## üõ°Ô∏è Scalability & Performance

ResQAI utilizes multi-region availability through **Google Cloud Run** to handle high traffic and ensure low latency during critical times. The integration with Vertex AI ensures rapid processing of complex datasets.
